# @lydell/node-pty

Fork of [microsoft/node-pty](https://github.com/microsoft/node-pty) with prebuilt binaries.

- Only supports platforms with prebuilt binaries. (Never builds with node-gyp at install.)
- Removed support for old versions of Windows. (Removed winpty, only supports conpty.)

## pty.js

microsoft/node-pty is forked from [chjj/pty.js](https://github.com/chjj/pty.js) with the primary goals being to provide better support for later Node.js versions and Windows.
